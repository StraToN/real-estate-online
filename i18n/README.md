# [Real Estate Online](https://www.binogure-studio.com) translations

A repository for Real Estate Online's translation efforts. There are only two folders:

- **languages** contains a list of files for every supported languages
- [**steam-page**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1810050/Real_Estate_Online_The_multiplayer_board_game/) contains two files for every supported languages, one for the short description, one for the long description

## Contributing languages

A language is just a yaml file that maps phrases in English to phrases in another
language. Here's a small example:

```yaml
# Comments start with an octothorpe
# Write whatever notes are necessary in a comment

# Here's a mapping of a hypothetical Real Estate Online phrase:

TOOLTIP_RECRUIT: List potential candidates available in town
```

Mappings will appear as:

```yaml
IDENTIFIER: [Phrase printed according to language options]
```

When translating languages type the translated phrase below the English phrase.
Here is an example of a hypothetical Spanish translation:

```yaml
TOOLTIP_RECRUIT: Lista de posibles candidatos disponibles en la ciudad.
```

Sometime a phrase might contain a parameter. It is always `%s`.

```yaml
# First [b]%s[/b] matches the manufacturer of the platform
# Second [b]%s[/b] matches the platform's name
LABEL_PLATFORM_RELEASED_DESCRIPTION: "[b]%s[/b] has released a new platform: '%s'"
```

To print a single `%` we need to double it: `%%`.

```yaml
LABEL_LOAN_DESCRIPTION: >
    You need some extra money, we can help you. You can refund yourself with a loan of [b]%s$[/b].
    Our interests rates are as low as only [b]%s%%[/b], and you have [b]%s[/b] weeks to repay.
    Its like a whole life for a company like yours. We are your last option, let yourself be tempted.
```
All languages files should be named `[language].yaml`.
